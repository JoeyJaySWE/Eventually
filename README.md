## Eventually
Hand in project with a deadline of 2 weeks to make a website in Larvel.
Me and my collegue desided that we'd like to make a event planer that
tries to keep it's site privacy first firendly by only storing minimum amounts of
personal data and making more of a event page with built in guest books for comments.
Why guestbook you may ask, well, cause a guest book offers you the option
to type something about your stay and can either be anonymous or you can leave a signature.
The only one who's name gets listed is the host.
