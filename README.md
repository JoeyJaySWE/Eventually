## Eventually
A Hand-in project with a deadline of 2 weeks to make a website in Larvel. My colleague and I decided that we'd like to make an event planner that tries to keep its site privacy-first friendly by only storing minimum amounts of personal data and making more of an event page with built-in guest books for comments. Why guestbook you may ask, well, cause a guest book offers you the option to type something about your stay and either be anonymous or leave a signature. The only one whose name gets listed is the host.
